# 🧠 DSA Roadmap for Big Tech Interviews

---

## ✅ PHASE 1: Master the Basics
**🎯 Goal:** Build strong foundational understanding.

### 📌 Step 1: Learn Core Concepts  
Focus on **theory + implementation**:

- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists (singly, doubly)  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Hash Tables (Maps/Sets)  
- Trees (Binary, BST)  
- Graphs (basic traversal: DFS, BFS)  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Sorting Algorithms (Quick, Merge, Heap, etc.)  
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, etc.)

### 🛠️ Recommended Resources:
- [NeetCode DSA Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)
- [CS50 by Harvard](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) — for low-level C-style fundamentals

---

## ✅ PHASE 2: Solve Easy/Medium Problems (Pattern Recognition)  
**🎯 Goal:** Learn patterns, not just solutions.

### 📌 Step 2: Use Pattern-Based Learning  
Focus on **popular coding patterns**:

- Sliding Window  
- Two Pointers  
- Fast & Slow Pointers  
- Binary Search on Answer  
- Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming (start small)

### 🛠️ Practice Platforms:
- [LeetCode: Top Interview Questions](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/)
- [Blind 75](https://blind75.com/)
- [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/)

---

## ✅ PHASE 3: Master Problem Solving Under Pressure  
**🎯 Goal:** Think + code within **30-45 minutes** per problem.

### 📌 Step 3: Daily Timed Practice  
- Use a timer. Solve **2–3 problems** per day.  
- Focus on:
  - Problem-solving process  
  - Clean and readable code  
  - Edge case handling  
  - Space and time complexity analysis  

### 🛠️ Tools & Platforms:
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) (focus on **Mediums**; mix in **Hards**)  
- [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) or **AlgoExpert**  
- [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/) or [Interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/) for mock interviews  

---

## ✅ PHASE 4: System Design & Behavioral Prep  
**🎯 Required for:** Intermediate or senior roles.

- Learn **System Design basics**:
  - Scalability  
  - Load balancing  
  - Database sharding  
  - Caching  
  - APIs  

- Practice **behavioral questions** using the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

### 🛠️ Good Resources:
- [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview)
- *System Design Interview* by Alex Xu

---

## ✅ PHASE 5: Mock Interviews + Real Practice  
**🎯 Goal:** Simulate real interviews.

### 📌 Step 5: Get Feedback  
- Mock interviews with **peers or mentors**
- Use platforms like:
  - [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/) (free)
  - [Interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/) (free/paid)
  - [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io/) for mentorship

## 🔁 REPEAT STRATEGY

1. **Pick a topic** (e.g. Trees)  
2. **Learn** theory + walkthrough examples  
3. **Solve** 5–10 easy, then 10 medium problems  
4. **Take notes** on patterns and tricks  
5. **Review** old problems after a week

> ✨ Stay consistent. Think in patterns. And don’t just memorize — understand *why* the solution works.
